# FirstCliProject

The New York Times Best Seller Selector is a CLI, Command Line Interface, designed to give the user  more information about the books on the current Hardcover Fiction Best Seller List. The CLI scrapes data from the New York Times website to get information like book title, author, weeks on the best seller list and publisher.

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

Enter the following code to run the New York Times Best Seller Selector.

  $ bin/nyt_bestseller

## Development
